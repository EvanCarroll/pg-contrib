=head1 NAME

pg_updatedicts - build PostgreSQL dictionaries from myspell/hunspell ones

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pg_updatedicts>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pg_updatedicts> makes dictionaries and affix files from installed myspell
and hunspell dictionary packages available to PostgreSQL for usage with tsearch
and word stem support. In particular, it takes all I<*.dic> and I<*.aff> files
from /usr/share/myspell/dicts/, converts them to UTF-8, puts them into
/var/cache/postgresql/dicts/ with I<*.dict> and I<*.affix> suffixes, and
symlinks them into /usr/share/postgresql/I<version>/tsearch_data/, where
PostgreSQL looks for them.

Through postgresql-common's dpkg trigger, this program is automatically run
whenever a myspell or hunspell dictionary package is installed or upgraded.
